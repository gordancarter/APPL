# APPL
Generalized application framework for Raspberry Pi and Python

APPL is a framework for rapid application development on Raspberry Pi which is built around the tabbed-notebook metaphor. 
Configuration is achieved both at run-time and code-time by the use of configuration files and Python 3 code. 
In keeping with the RPi target, all GUI uses tkinter, and Python standard DB interfaces are used.  
Specific applications (i.e. PSMS) require logic to be coded for the relevant functions, and configuration additions as well.
